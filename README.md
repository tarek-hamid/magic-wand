# magic-wand

This repository holds code for a magic wand side project that I developed with open-source examples. The idea is to monitor incoming motion signals, make a classification of the signal (Alohomora or not alohomora), and if Alohomora is detected, send a signal to another Arduino to move a servo that would open box.
